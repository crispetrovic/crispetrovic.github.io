            <strong class="highlight">Hi! I'm Crissa. :)</strong>

            <br>
            <br>
            The beginning of February marks my exit from the legal industry and my full time<br>
            entry into the wonderful world of tech as a web developer! Definitely exciting!<br>

            <br>

            and unicorns make me happy. I also have a very serious side that pushes me <br>
            to grow as a human. There truly is power in change, and I'm hooked. :) <br>

            <br>
            Something I've learned along my journey in life is this:
            <br>
            If you're fighting or recovering from the throes of isolation, oppression, or <br>
            victimization, know that your future doesn't have to be controlled by your past, unless <br>
            that's what you desire. You are the author of your own story - make it a good one! <br>

            <br>
            <br>
